## Task 1: Predictive Modeling 🧠

### Objective:
Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.

### Steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Experiment with different algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Evaluation**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, R²).

### Key Features:
- Utilizes multiple machine learning models for comparison.
- Provides metrics to measure the performance of each model.

## Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis 🍴

### Objective:
Analyze customer preferences by examining the relationship between cuisines, ratings, and votes.

### Steps:
- **Cuisine Analysis**: Identify popular cuisines based on votes and ratings.
- **High-Rating Cuisines**: Determine cuisines that consistently receive high ratings.
- **Insights**: Highlight the most preferred cuisines and their impact on ratings.

### Key Features:
- In-depth analysis of cuisine preferences.
- Identifies trends and patterns in customer choices.

## Task 3: Data Visualization 📊

### Objective:
Create insightful visualizations to better understand the data.

### Steps:
- **Rating Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of ratings using histograms and bar plots.
- **Cuisine Comparison**: Compare the average ratings of different cuisines.
- **Feature Relationships**: Analyze the relationship between features and the target variable.

### Key Features:
- Stunning visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Offers a clear understanding of how various features impact ratings.
