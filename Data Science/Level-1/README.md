## Task 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing üîç

### Steps Completed:

1. **Load Data:**
   - Imported the dataset using `pandas`.
   - Displayed the first few rows and data info.

2. **Handle Missing Values:**
   - Filled missing values in the `Cuisines` column with "Unknown".

3. **Remove Duplicates:**
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows from the dataset.

4. **Analyze Target Variable:**
   - Explored the distribution of the `Aggregate rating` column using histograms.

### Key Insights:

- Missing values in `Cuisines` were handled effectively.
- The `Aggregate rating` distribution showed a slightly skewed pattern.

### Visualization:

| **Visualization**              | **Description**                                                             |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Histogram of Aggregate Ratings | Displayed the frequency of aggregate ratings with KDE for smoothness.       |

## Task 2: Descriptive Analysis üìä

### Steps Completed:

1. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical columns.

2. **Analyze Categorical Variables:**
   - Explored the distribution of `Country Code`, `City`, and `Cuisines`.
   - Visualized top 20 cities and cuisines with the highest number of restaurants.

3. **Identify Top Entries:**
   - Listed top 10 cuisines and cities by the number of restaurants.

### Key Insights:

- Significant variation observed in `Average Cost for two` and `Votes`.
- Cities like New York and Delhi NCR dominate the restaurant count.

### Visualization:

| **Visualization**                | **Description**                                                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Countplot of Country Codes       | Showed the number of restaurants per country.                              |
| Top 20 Cities by Restaurants     | Bar chart displaying cities with the highest number of restaurants.        |
| Top 20 Cuisines by Restaurants   | Bar chart displaying the most popular cuisines.                            |

## Task 3: Geospatial Analysis üåç

### Steps Completed:

1. **Map Visualization:**
   - Visualized restaurant locations using latitude and longitude.
   - Created scatter plots to represent geographic patterns.

2. **Location-Based Analysis:**
   - Analyzed restaurant distribution across cities and countries.
   - Explored correlation between location and aggregate rating.

### Key Insights:

- High-density clusters observed in urban areas.
- Strong correlation between prime locations and higher ratings.

### Visualization:

| **Visualization**                | **Description**                                                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Global Restaurant Distribution   | Scatter plot of restaurant locations on a world map.                       |
| Correlation Analysis             | Heatmap to explore relationships between location and ratings.             |
